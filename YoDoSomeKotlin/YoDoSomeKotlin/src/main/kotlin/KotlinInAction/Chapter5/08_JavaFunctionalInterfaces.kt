/*
    *   Kotlin Lambdas are interoperable with Java Functional interfaces
    *   Java anonymous inner classes usually have one abstract method
    *   This method takes one input and has a body.
    *   These interfaces are called Functional Interfaces
    *   In Kotlin they are called SAM Interfaces -> Single Abstract Method
    *   This is similar signature with a kotlin lambda (View) -> Unit
    *
